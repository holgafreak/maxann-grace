maxann-grace
============

a simple algorithmic composer using code from Maxanneal (Iazetta et al) and Grace with s7-scheme

This actually does someything interesting. Fast, but limited to 4 voices and scores of max. 256 semiquavers.

fract-scm.cm is very old fractal generator, I think commonmusic had to be 
started (stella), now partly ported to s7.
